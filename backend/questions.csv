516,A production unit makes special type of metal chips by combining copper and brass. The standard weight of the chip must be at least 5 gms. The basic ingredients i.e. copper and brass cost ₹8 and ₹ 5 per gm. The durability considerations dictate that the metal chip must no contain more than 4 gms of brass and should contain minimum 2 gms of copper. Then the minimum cost of the metal chip satisfying the above conditions is,Rs.36,Rs.31,Rs.30,Rs.40,B,Maths,Algebra,Linear Programming,Easy,11-05-2024,Shift 1
